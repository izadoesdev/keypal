# API Keys

API keys in keypal are secure, cryptographically hashed tokens used for authentication and authorization.

## Key Format

Keys are generated with a configurable prefix and random string:

```
sk_live_abc123xyz456...
```

- **Prefix**: Identifies the key type (e.g., `sk_live_`, `sk_test_`)
- **Random String**: Cryptographically secure random characters

## Key Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Keys are generated and hashed before storage
2. **Storage**: Only the hash is stored, never the plain key
3. **Verification**: Keys are hashed and compared against stored hashes
4. **Revocation**: Keys can be soft-deleted (kept for audit trails)
5. **Rotation**: Old keys can be replaced with new ones

## Security Features

- **Cryptographic Hashing**: SHA-256 or SHA-512 hashing
- **Salt Support**: Optional salt for additional security
- **Timing-Safe Comparison**: Prevents timing attacks
- **Never Stored Plain**: Only hashes are stored in your database

## Key Metadata

Each key stores metadata including:

- Owner ID
- Scopes/permissions
- Resource-specific permissions
- Expiration date
- Tags
- Usage tracking (last used, created date)
- Status (enabled/disabled, revoked)
