# Memory Storage

Memory storage is the default storage adapter. It stores keys in a JavaScript Map in memory. No setup required - it works out of the box.

## Usage

```typescript
import { createKeys } from 'keypal'

// Memory storage is the default - no configuration needed
const keys = createKeys({
  prefix: 'sk_',
})

// Or explicitly specify it
const keys = createKeys({
  prefix: 'sk_',
  storage: 'memory',
})
```

## How It Works

Keys are stored in an in-memory `Map` structure:
- Key lookups are O(1) hash table operations
- No external dependencies
- No network calls
- Data exists only in the current process

## Important Notes

**Data is not persistent**: All keys are lost when your application restarts. This makes memory storage suitable for:
- Local development and testing
- Prototypes and demos
- Single-instance applications that don't need persistence

**Not distributed**: Each application instance has its own separate memory store. If you run multiple instances, they won't share keys.

For production use with persistence, use [Redis](/docs/storage/redis) or a database adapter like [Drizzle](/docs/storage/drizzle).
