# Storage Adapters

keypal supports multiple storage backends for persisting API keys. Choose the one that fits your infrastructure.

## Available Adapters

- **Memory** - In-memory storage (default, not persistent)
- **Redis** - Redis storage for distributed applications
- **Drizzle ORM** - PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite via Drizzle
- **Prisma** - PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite via Prisma
- **Kysely** - Type-safe SQL query builder
- **Convex** - Convex backend storage

## Choosing a Storage Adapter

### Use Memory When:
- Building prototypes or demos
- Testing locally
- You don't need persistence

### Use Redis When:
- You need distributed storage
- You want high performance
- You're already using Redis

### Use Drizzle/Prisma/Kysely When:
- You need persistent storage in a database
- You want to use your existing database
- You need complex queries

### Use Convex When:
- You're building with Convex
- You want real-time capabilities

## Custom Storage

You can also implement your own storage adapter by implementing the `Storage` interface. See [Custom Storage](/docs/storage/custom-storage) for details.
